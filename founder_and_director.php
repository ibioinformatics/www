Dr. Pandey has received numerous prestigious awards including the Experimental
  Pathologist-In-Training Award by the American Society for Investigative Pathology,
   Howard Temin Award from the National Cancer Institute, Sidney Kimmel Scholar
  Award by the Sidney Kimmel Foundation for Cancer Research and 
the Beckman Young Investigator Award by Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation.
He has recently received the Era of Hope Scholar Award by the United States Department
  of Defense which is "intended for exceptionally talented, early-career scientists
   who have demonstrated that they are the best and the brightest in their field(s)
  through extraordinary creativity, vision, and productivity, 
and who have shown a strong potential for leadership in the breast cancer community
  as well as a vision for the eradication of breast cancer." He
  is a past Editorial Board member of Genome Research and BMC Bioinformatics
   and currently serves as an Editorial Board member of Molecular and Cellular
   Proteomics,
  Journal of Proteome Research, Proteomics, Clinical Proteomics, Clinical and
   Translational Medicine and DNA Research and as an Associate Editor of Journal
   of Proteomics.</p> </td>
