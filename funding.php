  Identifying surface marker signature of oral cancer stem cells to develop a
      prognosis marker for oral squamous cell carcinoma using peptide-based CSC
      detection</strong></p>
              <p>Recently, a subset of cancerous cells namely cancer stem cells
                (CSC), in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC), has been implicated
                in tumor initiation, metastasis, chemo- and radiation-resistance
                and they were identified as candidates for prognostic prediction
                and targeted therapy. In an effort to understand the underlying
                mechanism and to identify the novel surface marker signatures
                of CSCs this proposal was put forth as a collaborative project
                between IOB and Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology and was
                funded by DBT, Government of India. A combination of 4-plex iTRAQ,
                Bioplex, FACS and confocal microscopy will be used to characterize
                the surface molecules in oral CSCs. Further a detection cocktail
                of CSC peptides will serve as a prognostic marker which can later
                be used for in vivo detection of metastasis in these cancers</p>

      Gallbladder cancer is a leading cancer in terms of mortality rates, which is largely due to lack of early detection. Objective of this research project is to discover biomarkers for early detection of gallbladder cancer. We are carrying out genome-wide expression profiling in gallbladder tumors using DNA microarrays to identify genes that are upregulated in gallbladder cancers. In addition, we will also carry out  proteomic profiling using quantitative and high resolution mass  spectrometry.&nbsp; Finally, we will validate potential biomarkers using immunohistochemical labeling of tissue microarrays.</p>
