Research work at Amrita was centered around understanding the structural, functional and genomic details of GLUT4, an insulin regulated glucose transporter.  His research work based on the functional modulation of GLUT4 identified several lead molecules having therapeutic potential to treat type 2 diabetes. A genomics study identified STRA6 (stimulated by retinoic acid gene 6) as a gene associated with type 2 diabetes thereby identifying a novel role for this gene.  Dr. Anilkumar has several years of research experience in functionally characterizing the role of key membrane proteins associated with diseases such as tuberculosis, cancer and diabetes.
